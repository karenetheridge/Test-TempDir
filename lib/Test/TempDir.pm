=head1 DEPRECATION NOTICE

There have been numerous issues found with this module, particularly with its
use of locks (unreliable, may result in your entire C<$TMPDIR> being deleted)
and MSWin32 compatibility. As well, it uses Moose, which is nowadays considered
to be heavier than necessary.

L<Test::TempDir::Tiny> was written as a replacement. Please use it instead!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::TempDir;

    my $test_tempdir = temp_root();

    my ( $fh, $file ) = tempfile();

    my $directory_scratch_obj = scratch();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::TempDir provides temporary directory creation with testing in mind.

The differences between using this and using L<File::Temp> are:

=over 4

=item *

=for stopwords creatable

If C<t/tmp> is available (writable, creatable, etc) it's preferred over
C<$ENV{TMPDIR}> etc. Otherwise a temporary directory will be used.

This is C<temp_root>

=item *

Lock files are used on C<t/tmp>, to prevent race conditions when running under a
parallel test harness.

=item *

The C<temp_root> is cleaned at the end of a test run, but not if tests failed.

=item *

C<temp_root> is emptied at the beginning of a test run unconditionally.

=item *

The default policy is not to clean the individual C<tempfiles> and C<tempdirs>
within C<temp_root>, in order to aid in debugging of failed tests.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 C<temp_root>

The root of the temporary stuff.

=head2 C<tempfile>

=head2 C<tempdir>

Wrappers for the L<File::Temp> functions of the same name.

=for stopwords overridable

The default options are changed to use C<temp_root> for C<DIR> and disable
C<CLEANUP>, but these are overridable.

=head2 C<scratch>

Loads L<Directory::Scratch> and instantiates a new one, with the same default
options as C<tempfile> and C<tempdir>.
